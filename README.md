# CSS Gameboy

I did this Gameboy in April 2014 after a boring lecture about Jakob Nielsen,  accesibility and usability. The lecture was not bad at all, but it was the third time I assisted, because I had to do that.

In that time, most of the CSS3 rules were not an standard and others not even existed. Nowadays, I am going to clean and update the code and fix that ugly buttons I never liked at all :P

I hope to undercover some old projecrts, like the scrolling 404 error page with SuperMario and King Koopa fighting, with the message "I am sorry, but the page you are looking for is in another Castle...", or the GameGear CSS3, or the "Botijo" CSS3...

Just for today, I am going to upload the old code, just like it is at http://laboratorio.pablofv.com/front-end/gameboy-con-css/

I will be uploading some updates when I have more free time
